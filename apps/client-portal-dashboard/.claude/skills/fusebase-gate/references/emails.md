## Fusebase Gate Email Operations

These operations send one-off emails to existing organization members through Gate.

## Relevant Operations

- sendOrgEmail sends an email to exactly one organization member in the requested org.

## Recipient Rules

- Treat `recipient` as required.
- Digit-only `recipient` strings are interpreted as user ids.
- `recipient` strings containing `@` are interpreted as email addresses.
- The resolved user must already belong to the organization. This operation is not an invite or provisioning flow.
- If you need to discover or confirm the target member first, use `listOrgUsers` before calling `sendOrgEmail`.

## Message Rules

- Send both `subject` and `body` under the request `body` payload.
- `body` is HTML or plain text; bare URLs are auto-linked and sanitized before delivery.
- The email is sent through the unbranded app layout with a noreply sender — no FuseBase branding — so put the final human-readable content in `body`.

## Access Model

- Sending org email requires `email.write` and org access.
- Gate resolves org membership before calling the internal mail service.
- If the call fails because the recipient is not found in the org, fix recipient selection or org membership instead of retrying the same payload.

## Response Interpretation

- A 201 means Gate accepted the send request for a resolved org member.
- `sentUserId` is the canonical recipient identity returned by the operation.
- `sentEmail` can be omitted if the resolved member record does not expose an email.

## Working Rules

- Always inspect the exact contract with `tools_describe` or `sdk_describe` before integration work.
- Treat `orgId` as required path input.
- Use this operation for one recipient at a time, not bulk mail.
