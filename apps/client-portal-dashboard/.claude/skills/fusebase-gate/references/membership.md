## Fusebase Gate Membership And Portal Flows

These prompts cover organization member invites/removal, workspace selection, portal discovery, portal magic-link behavior, and delayed Client account deletion exposed through Gate.

## Relevant Operations

- getMyOrgAccess: read the authenticated user's org access state without requiring existing org membership.
- getOrgUrl: resolve the organization's canonical HTTPS base URL (subdomain or custom CNAME domain).
- listWorkspaces: list workspaces visible in an organization and identify the default workspace.
- listPortals: list portals visible in an organization.
- listWorkspaceMembers: list members of a single workspace scoped to the org.
- listPortalMembers: portal-named alias for listing underlying workspace members by `workspaceId`.
- addOrgUser: create an org invite, workspace invite, or portal invite depending on payload shape.
- removeOrgMember: remove an organization member by numeric `userId`.
- removeWorkspaceMember: remove a workspace member by `workspaceId` plus numeric `userId`.
- removePortalMember: remove a portal member through the underlying `workspaceId` plus numeric `userId`.
- scheduleClientAccountDeletion: schedule delayed deletion for a target user only when their org role is `client`.

## Access Status Rules

- Use getMyOrgAccess for session-backed apps that need to distinguish signed-out users from authenticated users whose org membership is still being provisioned.
- Never unlock org UI from addOrgUser success alone; confirm with getMyOrgAccess.
- Do not use listOrgUsers as an authentication gate for onboarding flows.
- `membershipStatus: "ready"` means the current user already has org access.
- `membershipStatus: "none"` means the user is authenticated but does not currently have org membership.
- `membershipStatus: "expired"` or `"disabled"` means a membership record exists but should not grant access.

## Workspace Discovery Rules

- If the caller needs to choose where a member should be invited, call listWorkspaces first.
- The response marks the org default workspace with `isDefault: true`.
- `workspaceId` may be either a real workspace id or the literal alias `default`.
- In Gate, `default` is resolved by `orgId` to the organization's default workspace before calling org-service.

## Portal Discovery Rules

- Use listPortals when the caller needs existing portal domains for the organization.
- A portal belongs to both an `orgId` and a `workspaceId`.
- Portal listing is discovery-only; invitation still happens through addOrgUser.
- To list who belongs to a portal/facility workspace, call listWorkspaceMembers with the portal's `workspaceId` (or listPortalMembers with the same id). Do not use listOrgUsers when you need a workspace-scoped roster.

## Invite Flow Rules For addOrgUser

- Org invite: send `email` and optionally `orgRole`; omit `workspaceId`.
- Workspace invite: send `email`, `workspaceId`, and `workspaceRole`.
- Portal invite: send `email`, `workspaceId`, `workspaceRole`, and `portalUrl`.
- For instant client onboarding without invite confirmation, send `orgRole: "client"` with `autoConfirmClientInvite: true` and omit `workspaceId`.
- `autoConfirmClientInvite` is only valid for org-only client onboarding with `orgRole: "client"` and no `workspaceId`.
- Optional fields for workspace or portal invites: `orgRole`, `encryptRole`, `fullName`, `memberTTL`.
- Do not invent workspace ids or portal domains. Discover them first or use `workspaceId: "default"` when appropriate.

## Response Interpretation

- `target: "org"` means org-only membership flow.
- `target: "workspace"` means workspace membership flow.
- `target: "portal"` means portal magic-link flow.
- `result: "invite"` means an invite record exists, not that the current session already has org access.
- `result: "member"` means org-service returned an active membership record.
- `result: "link"` means org-service returned a portal magic link; inspect `magicLink` and related workspace membership fields.
- After addOrgUser, verify access through getMyOrgAccess before treating the target user as fully provisioned in the org.

## Workspace And Portal Member Listing

- listWorkspaceMembers returns `{ members: OrgWorkspaceMember[] }` for one workspace after Gate confirms it belongs to `orgId`.
- Each member includes `id` (workspaceMember globalId), `userId`, workspace `role`, `workspaceId`, and timestamps, plus org-membership fields joined by `userId`: `orgRole` (guest|client|member|manager|owner), `email`, `firstname`, `lastname`, and `isPortalManager`.
- Portal chat/provisioning: one listPortalMembers call is enough to (a) filter clients via `orgRole === 'client'`, (b) filter portal managers via `isPortalManager` (the official flag; `true` when `orgRole` is `manager` (what invitePortalManager grants) or `owner` — do not re-derive it), and (c) build a `Chat with <firstname lastname | email>` channel name. No separate listOrgUsers join needed.
- listPortalMembers uses the same response shape; pass the portal's underlying `workspaceId`, not the portal global id.
- Workspace outside the org returns 404. Requires org.members.read and org access.
- For per-facility or per-portal user management, prefer listWorkspaceMembers over listOrgUsers to avoid cross-workspace leakage.

## Removal And Client Account Deletion Rules

- Use listOrgUsers first when you need to verify a target user's org role before account-level deletion.
- removeOrgMember uses the numeric user id available from listOrgUsers. Gate resolves the internal org membership global id.
- removeOrgMember is unconditional unless you pass a precondition. When undoing your own invite, pass **both** `expectedRole` (the role you invited with) and `expectedJoinedAfter` (unix seconds taken before the invite) so a pre-existing or since-promoted member is never removed — either one alone still allows removing a since-re-invited or unrelated newer member. A mismatch fails with 409 and removes nothing; a param sent with an empty value fails with 400 rather than removing unconditionally.
- removeWorkspaceMember and removePortalMember use workspaceId plus numeric userId. Gate resolves the internal workspace membership global id when userId is passed; `members[].id` from listWorkspaceMembers is the same globalId.
- Removing an org member removes org membership; org-service owns related workspace/group cleanup.
- scheduleClientAccountDeletion takes numeric `userId` in the body and is allowed only for Client-role users in the requested org.
- Client account deletion is scheduled/delayed by user-service; do not promise immediate permanent deletion.

## Working Rules

- Always inspect the exact contract with tools_describe or sdk_describe before calling membership operations.
- Treat `orgId` as required path input for all membership and portal discovery operations.
- If a write fails, verify caller permissions and org access before assuming a schema problem.
