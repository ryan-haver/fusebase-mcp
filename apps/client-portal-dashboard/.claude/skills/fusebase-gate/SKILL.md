# Fusebase Gate MCP Skill

This document describes how to use **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** with **Fusebase Gate** during LLM development. Fusebase Gate is a service consumer built on top of the shared Fusebase platform runtime.

For rules and checklists, see `AGENTS.md`.

For **FuseBase PostgreSQL Database** (`sql` / `postgres` via the Gate `isolated-stores` contract), use **`references/isolated-sql.md`** for the MCP-oriented sequence and **`references/isolated-sql-migration-discipline.md`** whenever you edit or apply migration bundles (anti-drift). For runtime errors and support handoff, use **`references/isolated-sql-integrator-troubleshooting.md`**. Do **not** load operator runbooks (`isolated-sql-stores`, `isolated-sql-rls-plan`) — they are platform-internal. See TOC below.

**Critical isolated-store runtime rule:** a Gate isolated store is a platform-bound resource, not app environment configuration. Do not ask users to create app secrets or env vars for `storeId`, database IDs, physical database names, or provider connection details. Runtime code must resolve the store through Gate using the app token/source scope and stable alias (or use the store already bound by the platform). `storeId` may appear in MCP/operator handoff logs or CLI migration commands, but it must not be persisted as an app secret or hardcoded runtime config.

## When NOT To Use This Skill

- Do not use this skill for dashboard schema, rows, or `files` cell payload guidance. Load `fusebase-dashboards` for dashboard writes.
- Do not use this skill as the canonical low-level upload lifecycle reference. Load `file-upload/references/upload-lifecycle.md` for `tempStoredFileName -> storedFileUUID -> readUrl / relative url -> file descriptor`.
- Do not copy shared upload endpoint or payload blocks into Gate references. Gate guidance only owns Gate operations, auth, and scope.


## Anti-Overlap Checklist

- [ ] Unique scope: Gate operations and their auth/scope behavior.
- [ ] Neighbor links: use `file-upload` for upload lifecycle; use `fusebase-dashboards` for dashboard `files` columns.
- [ ] No duplicated dashboard `batchPutDashboardData` payload details here.
- [ ] Only hand off `storedFileUUID`, `readUrl`, or file descriptor outputs to neighboring skills.


## Verify gate MCP connection

Before any work with gate MCP, verify that the **fusebase-gate** MCP server is connected.

1. Check that MCP tools from the gate server are present (e.g. `tools_list`, `tools_search`, `tool_call`, `bootstrap`, `prompts_list`, `prompts_search`).
2. If the gate server is not available, inform the user and suggest checking MCP server settings.

---


## MCP vs SDK

- **MCP tools** — for performing actions inside the LLM session: discovery, token management, org user listing, health checks.
- **SDK** — for runtime code (e.g. service/browser/worker). Use `@fusebase/fusebase-gate-sdk` from npm in application code.

---


## Bootstrap and connection context

1. Read the resource **`resource://connection/context`** (if the client supports MCP Resources).
2. Or call the **`bootstrap`** tool (no arguments) and use the response for `defaults.toolArgs`, `usage`, `capabilities`.

---


## Tooling flow

After connection is established: discover operations via `tools_list` / `tools_search`, get schemas via `tools_describe`, execute via `tool_call`. For prompts, use `prompts_search` with appropriate `groups` (e.g. authz, bootstrap, tooling).

## Gate SDK runtime patterns for reliable permission sync

When runtime code uses `@fusebase/fusebase-gate-sdk`, `fusebase feature update --sync-gate-permissions` relies on static analysis of SDK method calls. Prefer these patterns so operations are detected reliably:

1. Keep direct method calls on API instances:
   - `const api = createWorkspacesApi(token)`
   - `await api.listWorkspaces(...)`
2. Prefer strongly typed API factories (`WorkspacesApi`, `NotesApi`, etc.), avoid `any` return types for Gate API objects.
3. Avoid dynamic call patterns for Gate operations:
   - avoid destructuring methods (`const { listWorkspaces } = api`)
   - avoid computed operation names (`api[opName]` call style) unless the key is a string literal
4. Keep a pre-publish check in your workflow:
   - `fusebase analyze gate --operations --json --feature <featureId>`
   - if runtime imports Gate SDK and `usedOps` is empty, treat it as a blocker and fix before publish.


## Token permission mode (default soft)

Token permission validation is soft by default (`strictPermissionValidation = false`).

- If a request contains permissions the caller cannot grant, Gate degrades token permissions to the allowed subset.
- If a request contains unknown or service-disallowed permissions, Gate ignores those permissions in soft mode.
- Prefer the default soft mode for runtime integrations; enable strict mode only for explicit fail-fast requirements.


## SDK operation error handling

For runtime code with `@fusebase/fusebase-gate-sdk`, enforce explicit operation-level error handling:

- Wrap each Gate operation in `try/catch` and branch behavior by status code and operation intent.
- Treat `401/403` as expected authz outcomes (missing permission, scope mismatch, membership state) and return actionable guidance.
- Avoid implicit privileged fallback when user-context calls fail.
- For token operations, message that permission reduction can be expected in soft mode; only expect hard failure when strict mode is explicitly enabled.


## Security rule: no implicit service-token fallback

For user-facing Gate flows (membership status, current user/org access, workspace visibility), do not silently switch from feature-token auth to service-token auth when Gate returns auth errors.

- Required behavior: fail closed (`401/403`) and surface a clear runtime error.
- Forbidden behavior: "best-effort" fallback that returns data from owner/service context.
- If a feature truly needs service-token operations, keep them in explicit system/admin-only endpoints with audit logging and clear auth-source labeling.
