# App Dev Practices

## Always Scaffold First

Run `fusebase scaffold --template spa --dir apps/<name>` before writing any app files. This generates the canonical React + Vite + Tailwind v4 + shadcn/ui project structure. For apps needing a backend, also run `fusebase scaffold --template backend --dir apps/<name>`. Customize from there — never recreate boilerplate by hand.

## Multi-User by Default

**Every app is multi-user.** Multiple users access the same deployed app simultaneously, each with their own identity (app token). Never design for a single user.

**Rules:**
- **Per-user state** (OAuth tokens, preferences, selections) must be stored **per-user** — use httpOnly cookies (set by the server, scoped to the user's browser) or dashboard rows keyed by user ID
- **Shared env vars / Fusebase secrets** are global — they are the **same for all users**. Never use them for per-user credentials or settings
- **In-memory backend variables** are shared across all requests from all users — never store per-user data in module-level variables
- When integrating third-party APIs with OAuth, each user must go through their own auth flow and get their own tokens

- **Stable partition keys only:** when storing per-user rows, the partition key must come from a **stable identity** (`userId`, `orgUserId`, email if immutable), not from session/token artifacts.
- **Never use token-derived keys** (e.g. `ft:*`, JWT fragments, rotating session IDs) as persistent `user_key`/partition keys — they change between sessions and split one user's data into multiple buckets.
- **Recommended format:** normalize once in backend (`user:<userId>`) and reuse the same key for both read and write paths.

**Ask yourself:** "If two users open this app at the same time, will they interfere with each other?" If yes, the design is wrong.

## Project Structure

Apps are React/Vite apps in `apps/`:

```
apps/
  my-app/
    package.json
    vite.config.ts
    src/
      App.tsx
      main.tsx
```

Use existing apps in `apps/` as reference when building new ones.

### Vite Config: Ignore Logs Directory

`fusebase dev start` writes debug logs to `<app-dir>/logs/`. Tell Vite's file watcher to ignore this directory so it doesn't trigger unnecessary reloads:

```ts
// vite.config.ts
export default defineConfig({
  server: {
    watch: {
      ignored: ['**/logs/**'],
    },
  },
  // ...rest of config
});
```

**Always include this in every app's `vite.config.ts`.**

### Vite Config: Do NOT add inline `css.postcss`

Do **NOT** add a `css.postcss` block in `vite.config.ts`. An inline `css` config — even with an empty `plugins` array — **overrides** the external `postcss.config.js` entirely, silently disabling Tailwind and all other PostCSS plugins.

```ts
// ❌ BROKEN — overrides postcss.config.js, Tailwind never runs
export default defineConfig({
  css: {
    postcss: {
      plugins: [],
    },
  },
});
```

```ts
// ✅ CORRECT — no css.postcss block; Vite picks up postcss.config.js automatically
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  // ...rest of config
});
```

PostCSS plugins (`@tailwindcss/postcss`, `autoprefixer`) belong in `postcss.config.js` only.

### Backend (Optional)

Apps may optionally include a `backend/` subfolder for a backend API (REST + WebSockets). **Do not add a backend unless the app genuinely needs backend logic** — most apps work fine with the Dashboard SDK alone. See skill **app-backend** for when and how to add one. The backend is served at `/api`.

<!-- CUSTOM:SKILL:BEGIN -->
## Consuming Another Fusebase App's API

If your app needs to integrate with **another Fusebase app in the same organization**, do **not** treat that app as an external opaque service by default.

Use this workflow:

1. Discover the target app's published API through Gate:
   - `searchAppApiOperations`
   - `listAppApiOperations`
   - `getAppApiOperation`
2. Inventory the relevant operations and their request or response shapes.
3. Build the integration against that published contract.
4. Use `callAppApi` or direct runtime probing only if behavior still needs live verification.

Avoid these dead ends as a first move:

- searching for the target app's source code in the current repo
- asking for raw OpenAPI export or manual endpoint lists
- spelunking dashboard tables or storage schemas instead of using the published app API

If a published app API exists, it is the primary cross-app integration surface.

For security-sensitive operations, prefer contract-level app API policy:

- `x-fusebase-allowed-callers` restricts the caller identity: a caller id is the calling project's `productId`, e.g. `client:<productId>`, not an app id — sibling apps of one project share it.
- `x-fusebase-required-permissions` restricts caller capability and must use the app API namespace `app_api.<namespace>.<capability>.<action>`, e.g. `app_api.client_portal.provision.write`.
- Do not use built-in Gate permissions such as `isolated_store.read` for app-to-app operation authorization.
- **Enforcement arrives per environment.** Both extensions are published to the registry and read by `callAppApi`, but enforcement is switched on per environment by the platform. Declare them now and grant the matching capability to caller apps with `fusebase app update <callerAppId> --permissions "app_api.<namespace>.<capability>.<action>"`, so the grants are in place when enforcement reaches yours. Never rely on them as your only authorization check today.

## Authentication

Apps run as the main window. The platform sets a `fbsfeaturetoken` cookie automatically.

**Startup flow:**

1. Read app token on app load: check `fbsfeaturetoken` cookie first, fall back to `window.FBS_FEATURE_TOKEN` if the cookie is absent
2. Render app once token is available (show loading state until then)
3. Pass token via `x-app-feature-token` for direct SDK / Fusebase proxy calls
4. For calls to the app's own backend (`/api/*`), rely on the same-origin cookie and make backend handlers read `x-app-feature-token` or fallback to `fbsfeaturetoken`

**All apps MUST handle token expiration** (`AppTokenValidationError` / 401). See skill **handling-authentication-errors** for the implementation pattern.

### Backend session apps (httpOnly cookie)

If the app has a **backend** and the SPA boots auth from **`GET /api/account/me`** (or similar) with `credentials: 'include'`:

- Load **handling-authentication-errors** § **session probe invariant** before writing auth bootstrap code.
- **401 only** → login screen. **502/5xx/network** → retry with deploy tolerance, then transient error — **never** `setState('anon')` on proxy errors.
- **`fusebase deploy` restarts the backend** — session probe must survive the rollout window (see skill for retry delays).

Do not conflate this with platform `fbsfeaturetoken` expiry (`AppTokenValidationError` modal) — they are separate layers.

## User Details

Fetch current user:

```typescript
const response = await fetch('https://app-api.thefusebase.com/v4/api/users/me', {
  headers: { 'x-app-feature-token': appToken },
})
const user = response.ok ? await response.json() : null
// authenticated: { id: 4124, email: "testemail@gmail.com" }
// anonymous visitor on a public app: null
```

Important for public apps:

- A visitor app token may be valid even when `/users/me` returns 401
- In that case, treat the result as `user: null`, not as "session expired"
- Show the login/auth form for anonymous visitors
- Only show a "Session Expired" modal for actual `AppTokenValidationError` flows

See skill **handling-authentication-errors** for the exact 401 handling rules.

## Navigation

Use standard browser navigation (React Router, etc.) since apps run as the main window. For routing setup, see skill **app-routing**.

## UI Framework

Use **shadcn/ui**. For design and UX guidance (layout, tokens, components, accessibility), see skill **app-ui-design**.

## Building Apps

```bash
cd apps/my-app
npm run build
```

### devDependencies Missing

If `npm run build` fails because vite/typescript are not found, npm may be running in production mode (`NODE_ENV=production` — common in VS Code / Claude Code). Fix:

```bash
npm install --include=dev
```

### Typecheck at project root

From the repo root, `npm run typecheck` runs `tsc` for each app (see root `package.json`). It catches strict TypeScript issues that ESLint does not, including the same failures as `tsc` inside `fusebase deploy`’s build. Claude Code Stop hooks run it after lint.

## Registering Apps

After creating an app, register it via `fusebase app create` from the project root:

```bash
fusebase app create --name <name> --subdomain <subdomain> --path <path> --dev-command <command> --build-command <command> --output-dir <dir>
```

**Execute this command automatically** after writing the app code — do not ask the user to run it manually.

### Access Principals

Use `--access` to control who can access the app. Principals are comma-separated:

```bash
# Public (visitor) access
fusebase app create --name <name> --access=visitor
fusebase app update <appId> --access=visitor

# Org role access (guest, client, member, manager, owner)
fusebase app update <appId> --access=orgRole:member
fusebase app update <appId> --access=orgRole:member,orgRole:client

# Combine visitor and org roles
fusebase app update <appId> --access=visitor,orgRole:member
```

### Permissions

Use `--permissions` with `fusebase app create` when the app is first registered. Only use `fusebase app update --permissions` when changing permissions on an already-registered app. Use MCP to discover dashboard/view IDs. See skill **fusebase-cli** for permission format and examples.

## Getting App URLs

```bash
fusebase app list
```

Lists all apps with their deployed URLs. Use this to get actual URLs — do NOT hardcode or guess them.

**Always use the full subdomain URL** (read `FUSEBASE_APP_HOST` from `.env`, e.g. `https://my-app.thefusebase.app/`), never relative paths. Each app is served from its own subdomain root — see skill **app-routing**.

## Cross-App Navigation

Use standard browser navigation (`<a>`, `window.location`) with full app URLs obtained from `fusebase app list`.
